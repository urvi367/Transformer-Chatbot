## Transformer Chatbot

The proposed project aims to create a **generative model for conversational ai agents**, limited to the language English. The agent must be able to comprehend the input statement and generate close-to-human responses.<br />
It aims to aid people with their mental health issues, hence acting as a **TherapyBot**.

The proposed Conversational agent is meant to operate within the **psychological space** adhering to the following: 
 - Quick response generation
 - Context relevant responses
 - Grammatically correct responses
 
 Tensorflow 2.0 has been used for this usecase.
 
 ### Dataset used
